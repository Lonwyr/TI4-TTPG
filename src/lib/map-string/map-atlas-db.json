As the Mahact fire up their ancient machines, a desperate contest is about to take place. The machines on Acheron tear space itself and a terrible new threat, the Vuil'raith emerge. The Argent scramble to fulfil their oaths as sacred guardians. Mahact prepares to propel Ixth back towards the center of the galaxy. The Creuss try to find a way to undo the ruin they've just unleashed, and prevent the Prophecy of Kings.  (Thematic note: in this scenario, points do not represent the will of the council, but progress with the understanding and use of the Acheron gates.)  Special Rules: Each player chooses one of the following races: Vuil'raith, Argent, Mahact, and Creuss. The races' starting locations can not be moved.  Mahact starts with the speaker token.  Remove the Trade and Warfare strategy cards from the game; they can never be chosen. Players will choose only one strategy card in the strategy phase.  Because there is no custodians token on this map, there will be no agenda phase. Any action card or secret objective that can only be used in the agenda phase gains the text 'ACTION: Discard this card to refresh your commodities.' (Note that this will allow Vuil'raith to use their agent.)  The first player to 8 points is the victor."

        "comments": "I began the names of each slice with the Upper most slice that is clockwise from the furthest north tile location.   This map is intended to provide tension/conflict around Mecatol Rex, where each tile adjacent to the center is considered an equidistant system for 2 home system locations.   It is common for planetary systems of an individual slice to be adjacent to one another. As this results in a more center focused map, many of the empty space tiles were placed on the outer rim of the map.   There are very few anomalies on this map (a total of 5, 1 being a supernova), and Legendary planets are placed in a way that they are considered equidistant 2 or more slices (See wormholes).   Points of Conflict: * Any system adjacent to MR * Objectives that require Planetary types, like 4 of a type. * 1st and 2ndary tech skips have been placed in a way that some factions might need to fight one-another. * Control Objectives are much easier to disrupt do to the system adjacency of neighbors.  Starting Slices: *Factions have the option of taking systems that are equidistant to both their neighbors and can advantageous for factions that start with increased movement on ships with capacity. * I tried balancing each slice based on only the systems adjacent to the home system and what their 2 options were for systems adjacent to Mecatol Rex.  Strongest to Weakest Slice (in my opinion): 1. One Sided 2. Hello Neighbor 3. The Long Road 4. Runaway Incursion 5. One Two Three 6. Take What You Can, Give Nothing Back"

The additional tiles in the central ring made accounting for all objectives far easier and prevents PDS2 breaking the game. All objectives should be scorable but being 3 player you always need a little flexibility with certain objectives."

The Emperor has the strongest position with easy access to MR, 2 legendaries that produce GF, and a blue skip all in an easily defensible position. They are hindered however in the fact that they cannot score victory points without expanding which puts a lot of pressure on the other players to contain  them.   Each other slice has a wormhole with easy resources, a couple of tech skips, and a wormhole to trade. The excess should make VP's easy to score.   The Duke can score an easy 4 planet type point, but his tech skips being in danger make for a tenuous relation with the others.   The Bishop likewise suffers from proximity to the Emperor but is an a thankfully more guarded position. His RY techs might prove the difference in an all out war.   The Prince has the richest slice, and his 2 green skips allow for a potential counter to the Emperor's ground game. But who is willing to trade one tyrant for another?  The Countess's slice largely reflects the Emperor's and a BR tech path opens up options for a lot of factions. Efficient planets with lots of CC's could open up a lot of doors for potential plays.   The problem remains, with only 1 person able to claim the throne, can they work together to stop the looming threat?"
